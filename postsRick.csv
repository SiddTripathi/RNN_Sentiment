"I am Justin Roiland, co-creator of Rick and Morty and co-founder of Squanch Games. Our first game, Trover Saves the Universe, is out on PS4 and PC today. AMA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/bwpp5s/i_am_justin_roiland_cocreator_of_rick_and_morty/,"Hey everyone, Justin Roiland here. I co-created a show called Rick and Morty. You‚Äôve probably never heard of it. It‚Äôs not very popular. I think it only airs in The Bahamas at like... 3:00 in the morning. But whatever.

I also co-founded a game dev studio called Squanch Games with Tanya Watson. She was the EP on Fortnite at Epic Games. She's also happily married with two children. Man. She's got it all. And what do I got? Nothing. Besides this collectors edition Star Wars cup and some old Pez.

This life is meaningless. We're all just quickly rolling ever faster towards the gaping black hole of death.
Jesus, I am all over the place with this thing. I think I need to lie down...

Ok, I‚Äôm back. Anyway, our first full-length game, Trover Saves the Universe, is OUT NOW ON PC AND PLAYSTATION 4! We‚Äôre really excited about it, and we‚Äôve got some people from Squanch Games here to answer all your questions:

- Me | /u/justinroiland
- Mikey Spano (Art Director) | u/squanchmikey
- Anthony Bosco (Narrative Editor) | /u/squanchbosco

Here's a trailer and stuff: 
>https://youtu.be/A8RuXriyPK0

**And something featuring some characters from Rick and Morty that you might recognize (but probably not)**:
>https://youtu.be/UhVZ94qnbOc 

A bit about the game:

- Trover Saves the Universe is your classic, run-of-the-mill story about your dogs being dognapped by a beaked lunatic named Glorkon. And get this, he stuffed your lil puppos into his eye holes, allowing him to destroy the universe. Now, it's up to you and Trover to stop him.

Mmm. Wow. That storyline is classic. Classic like a BLT sandwich, you know?

Did I mention you can play it in both VR and NON-VR! This game is a real hot ticket item folks! So, drop whatever you‚Äôre doing, unless you‚Äôre holding a baby, and go buy Trover Saves the Universe!

More details at [trover.site](https://www.troversavestheuniverse.com/)!

**UPDATE: Ok. So, I had to be in the edit bay with Harmon literally 40 minutes ago. We don't want season four to get delayed for an AMA right? I do feel bad that I am so slow with this. I tried to go fast. I'll come back later after the edit and keep going! You guys are awesome! I really hope you check out Trover, it was a dream to make and we are super proud of it.**

**UPDATE 2 (7pm PST) I'm going to try to get through as many of these as I can! Here we go**

**UPDATE 2.5 (10pm PST) Ok, I feel a bit better. I did some more. I pulled it off. Mission accomplished. Be a good person to those around you JUST IN CASE you are them. Read Andy Weir's the egg and you'll know what I mean. See ya when I am you!**",30820,2019-06-05 03:00:45,126
